## 🌐 Deployment (Railway)

This project is configured out-of-the-box for deployment on [Railway.app](https://railway.app/).

### Prerequisites for Deployment
- Make sure you do **NOT** commit `node_modules` to your Git repository. The project includes a root `.gitignore` to prevent this.

### Backend Deployment
1. Create a new Railway project → **Add Service** → **GitHub Repo**.
2. Navigate to Service Settings and set the **Root Directory** to `/backend`.
3. Add the following **Environment Variables**:
   - `MONGO_URI` = Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` = A strong random secret string
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
   - `CLIENT_URL` = Your deployed frontend URL (for CORS)
4. Deploy the service. It uses `railway.toml` to automatically run `node server.js`.

### Frontend Deployment
1. In the same Railway project, add another service from the same GitHub Repo.
2. Navigate to Service Settings and set the **Root Directory** to `/frontend`.
3. Add the following **Environment Variable**:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = Your deployed backend URL + `/api` (e.g., `https://backend-service.up.railway.app/api`)
4. Deploy the service. It uses the frontend `railway.toml` to run `npm run build` and serves it on port 3000 using `serve`.
